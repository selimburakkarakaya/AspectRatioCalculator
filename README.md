# AspectRatioCalculator

This JavaScript code provides a means to calculate the width and height values of an image while preserving its aspect ratio. It allows users to enter a specific aspect ratio (for example, 16:9) and one of the width or height values, allowing the other size to be automatically calculated.

How does it work?

1. The user enters the width and height values, as well as the desired aspect ratio.

2. When the user enters or changes any value, the other dimension is calculated through JavaScript functions.

3. When the width or height value is changed, the opposite dimension (i.e. height or width) is automatically calculated and printed in the corresponding input field.

4. After the user enters the desired aspect ratio and width or height values, the other size is automatically calculated and presented to the user.

Features:

- Width and Height Calculation: When the user enters the width or height value, the other dimension is automatically calculated, thus preserving the aspect ratio.

- Aspect Ratio Flexibility: Users can specify their desired aspect ratio, allowing them to scale images to fit various screen sizes and devices.

- Precise Calculation: When calculating the width or height value, the result is truncated and rounded to two decimal places, to get a more precise result.

This tool helps users adjust the dimensions of images quickly and accurately, thus maintaining the desired aspect ratio and optimizing the appearance of images.
